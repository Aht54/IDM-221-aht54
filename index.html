    <h1>Passions</h1>
    <p>As I`ve gotten older, my definition of life has been constantly changing at an everyday pace. 
    Along the way, these 3 things have been the most recent passions that I`ve recently discovered by getting 
    out of my comfort zone. The one main lesson that I have learned from each of these passions is that anything 
    new that you decide to take on, will always be a struggle initally but over time, it can be polished to a very
    useful skills I`ve personally symbolized.

        <h2>Photography</h2>
        <h3>Attention</h3>
        <p>I was always drawn to Photography in a way where I was afraid from making the transition
            to a higher level because of how addicted it could be. Turns out... I was right! Now I almost always 
            have my camera on me and ready to capture anything that catches my eye.

        <h2>Volleyball</h2>
        <h3>Reliance</h3>
        <p>I started playing Volleyball in High School and it was one of the best decisions I`ve ever made. 
            The sport taught me how to build connections and emphasized the critical importance of an team environment.
            Growing up I had a hard time opening up to people and had a constant sense of self-reliance which I`m glad to 
            have grown out of.</p>

        <h2>Drawing</h2>
        <h3>Patience</h3>
        <p>When I saw a drawing course on my schedule for the fall term, I was honestly not looking forward to it at all
            because of the thought of overwhelming embarassment. I`ve never been a fan of drawing nor had the talent but 
            over the course of this term, I now realize that I just had to give the process a chance. Looking back at my
            struggles in the beginning and comparing it to the results now, I`m proud of what I was able to accomplish.
